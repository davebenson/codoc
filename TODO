what about non-`typedef struct _X X;' naming schemes?

- for some reason all-constructs.h seems to give a lot of warnings.
  (maybe verify that my last patch to libcodoc.c to add
  bit-field support didn't blow it)
- make the codoc.template file support type_suffixes for
  member arrays and bitfields to work.

test:
  bodyless struct's: typedef struct _X X;

To consider supporting
  #define's   [but which?]

Not supported:
  anonymous unions, enums, or structs
  nested structures
