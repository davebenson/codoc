This is a tool for documenting the public interfaces
of a C library or the internals of a C program.

It scans the .h files in the current directory, makes
a list of all the functions and other C objects, and a
"template".  It writes out an updates template containing
any new functions.  Then if that changed it writes out a
new DocBook SGML description of your function.
