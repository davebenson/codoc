codoc (???)
 
  * worked on support for bitfields (daveb)
  * remove CPP_FLAGS, a source of cvs conflicts (daveb/pmineiro)
  * switched to docbook-xml.  okay, this is technically cruel,
    but i'm sure new users will appreciate it, and docbook sgml seems
    done for.  the only really important changes are
    - you must install/use tools for processing docbook xml 
      instead of sgml-tools, while is obsolete. [see manual]
    - in codoc.template, you must change any docbook-sgml idioms not
      accepted by docbook-xml to proper docbook-xml.
